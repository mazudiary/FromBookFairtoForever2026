            That morning, Nusrat Apu tried to convince me to attend biology
            class. She said,
            <span style="color: #ffd1dc">"Come to class on 14 February."</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            But I refused. I had already planned to go to the Book Fair with
            another friend. I didn't tell anyone.

            I stayed silent. I didn't argue. I didn't explain. Because even I

          <h2>That Afternoon at the Fair</h2>

          <p>
            Ekushey Boi Mela, February 14, 2020. The warm afternoon sun filtered
            through the trees, mixing with the scent of new books and the golden
            dust of the fairgrounds. We were just three friends me, my friend,
            and a friend of a friend wandering through the crowded stalls, lost
            in the vibrant sea of stories.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, the world seemed to stand still. Eva’s eyes suddenly lit up as
            she spotted a familiar face in the golden light. She called out your
            name <strong>"Lopa!"</strong> and just like that, a long-awaited
            reunion between two old friends became the very first page of *our*
            story.

            That single shout in the afternoon crowd was the start of
            everything. 💕

          <p>
            Amongst thousands of books and endless paths, fate made sure our
            orbits finally crossed. What started as a chance meeting between
            friends became the friendship I had been praying for all along a
            moment where I found the soul I could finally share my everything
            with.
